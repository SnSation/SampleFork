Goals
-------------------------

1. Fork a GitHub repository and clone it to my local machine
2. Add the original repository as an upstream
3. Make some changes and push them to this repository

Key Features
------------

**Forked Repository:**
Sample Fork is an offshoot of [Sample Project](https://github.com/SnSation/SampleProject "Original Repository: SampleProject") which had all the functionality of SampleFork v1.0 with some changes to documentation and included files.

**New README.md:**
Sample Fork has an updated README.md that is distinctly different from Sample Project's [README.md](https://github.com/SnSation/SampleProject/README.md "Sample Project's README.md")

Integrated Technology
-----------------------
**Languages:**
- MarkDown

**Software:**

    ![Clone Link](https://github.com/SnSation/SampleFork/images/clone_link.png)

4. Navigate to the directory on your computer you want to work from, and clone the repository

    `$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_PROJECT`

5. (Optional) Add the original repository as an upstream so you can access any updates

    `$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ANOTHER_USER/THEIR_REPOSITORY`



Using Sample Fork
------------
### The Simplest Case

- Now that you own your own fork, you can treat it as your own project!
- Make whatever changes you want and upload them to your own repository

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE"
$ git push origin BRANCH
```

### Contributing to the Origial Repository
- You can try to contribute your changes to the original repository with a pull request
- Details can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork "Pull Requests from a Fork")
